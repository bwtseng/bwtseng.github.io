# Andes Tech 
I have worked in Andes since Mar 2020. The objective of this job is to develop model compression algorithm, including pruning and quantization. More specifically, we aim to attain smaller deep learning models whilst applying them on Andes CPU platform. In literature, this is a hot topic called "Efficient AI", we all target at how to port DNN on the device with limited computation resource, and how to accelerate the inference computation time using the property of your hardware design.

# Mediatek Research Lab
I had worked in Mediatek Research Lab (MTKR) from Jan 2020 to Mar 2020. This job content is to develop a dialogue system, inclduing NLP algorithm and web service platform based on Node.js. It is worth mentioning that I also participated the physical design code conversion project.
